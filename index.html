      <h4>Tableau dashboard</h4>
      <div class="multi-column">
        <p>
          Worked on a global air pollution dataset in Tableau, focusing on visualizing NO₂ and CO₂ levels across major cities. 
          The dataset was processed to categorize cities into two groups: 
          "Danger" or "Not in Danger" zones, based on pollution thresholds set by health organizations like the WHO.
           Using color-coded markers and dynamic filters, the dashboard provided an interactive way to explore air quality trends globally. It highlighted cities exceeding safe NO₂ and CO₂ levels, making it easy to identify high-risk areas. This project demonstrated the power of data visualization in environmental monitoring and decision-making.

        <span>This project involves creating a Python tool that pauses YouTube or Spotify playback when a finger snap sound is detected. 
          It uses a microphone to capture audio in real-time via libraries like pyaudio or sounddevice. 
          The audio is preprocessed and analyzed using features like MFCC, which are passed through a machine learning model
           (e.g., SVM or CNN) to detect the finger snap. Once detected, the tool uses APIs (YouTube Data API for 
           YouTube and Spotify Web API) or browser automation (via selenium) to control media playback, pausing the video or
            song automatically.</span>

        <h4>Research Paper: Analysis of financial markets using quantum computing techniques</h4>
        <div class="multi-column-3">
          <p>
            Quantum computing, when combined with ML, enhances these capabilities by
            leveraging quantum properties like superposition and entanglement, which allow for
            faster computations and the handling of more complex data structures. Quantum ML
            models, including Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) and Quantum Support Vector
            Machines (QSVMs), can process large-scale financial data more efficiently, enabling
            more accurate predictions in areas such as volatility forecasting and portfolio
            optimization. Therefore, this synergy can deeply analyze market behavior and predict it
            accordingly, especially in high frequency and long-range prediction analysis.

            Traditional models are facing immense challenges when dealing with nonlinear and
highly dynamic financial markets. Machine learning, on the other hand, is more robust in
dealing with these markets, since it can operate with enormous volumes of data and
detect hidden trends in the markets while adjusting with its changing trends. ML models
efficiently analyze historical price data, sentiment analysis, and high-frequency trading
patterns. Algorithms such as Random Forests, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and
neural networks, particularly recurrent and convolutional neural networks (RNNs,
CNNs), can predict price movements, identify market trends, and assess risk.

          <h4>Internship</h4>
          <p>During my two-month internship at SRET, I worked on an advanced machine learning project titled **"Real-time Crime Detection Using CCTV Cameras."** The project aimed to enhance public safety by leveraging the power of machine learning and video analytics to monitor CCTV feeds in real-time, identifying suspicious activities or potential crimes as they occurred.

            The core of the system was built using **TensorFlow**, which was employed for developing deep learning models capable of recognizing patterns and anomalies in video feeds. I worked on training these models using various datasets of pre-labeled criminal and non-criminal activities to ensure accurate classification. We used **OpenCV**, an essential library for image and video processing, to preprocess the video streams from CCTV footage, allowing for tasks such as object detection, motion tracking, and scene segmentation. This preprocessing was critical for extracting relevant features that would be fed into the machine learning models.
            
            In addition, **SciPy** was used for scientific computing tasks, including mathematical optimizations and handling multi-dimensional data arrays, while **scikit-learn** provided essential tools for data classification, regression, and model validation. Together, these libraries allowed for the development of a highly responsive system capable of analyzing video frames in real time, identifying suspicious behavior such as loitering, sudden movements, or large gatherings.
            
            Throughout the project, I gained valuable experience not only in the technical aspects of machine learning and video analytics but also in understanding the integration of these technologies into real-world security systems. The project demonstrated how AI can be used to improve public safety, offering a practical solution for crime prevention and law enforcement. </p>
